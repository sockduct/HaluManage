Ulysses S. Grant, the first president to declare a national park (Yellowstone), was born on April 27, 1822, and died on July 23, 1885. Grant's presidency lasted from March 4, 1869, to March 4, 1877, during which he declared Yellowstone National Park in 1872. Therefore, both Muir and Grant were alive from April 27, 1822, until July 23, 1885. The two would have overlapped during Muir's lifetime until Grant's death, which means they were both alive at the same time for approximately 66 years, 2 months, and 27 days until Grant's passing.""]"

The Willis Tower has a height of 1,451 feet (443 m). To find out how many Coit Towers would need to be stacked on the Willis Tower to exceed the Spire's height, we first find the remaining height needed beyond the Willis Tower: 2000 - 1451 = 549 feet. Next, we divide that height by the height of Coit Tower: 549 / 210 = 2.61. Since we cannot have a fraction of a tower, we round up to the next whole number, which is 3. Therefore, it would take 3 Coit Towers stacked on the Willis Tower to exceed the height of the Chicago Spire.""]"
