# Evaluation of Performance Trends and Sourcing Strategies in Mid-Market Private Equity Buyouts

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive evaluation of performance trends and sourcing strategies within the mid-market private equity (PE) buyout sector. The mid-market is characterized by companies with enterprise values typically ranging from $50 million to $500 million, with technology, healthcare, and business services being dominant sectors. Investment theses often focus on operational improvements and growth initiatives, with deals typically financed using a significant portion of debt. Sourcing strategies are increasingly favoring proprietary channels and leveraging digital platforms and industry expertise to identify off-market opportunities, driven by competitive pressures and a desire for better deal terms. Performance metrics such as Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Multiple on Invested Capital (MOIC) remain key benchmarks, with recent trends indicating a shift towards operational excellence for value creation, moving away from purely financial engineering. While exit activity has shown signs of recovery, challenges such as heightened competition, valuation pressures, and regulatory changes persist. However, opportunities arise from technological advancements, demographic shifts, and evolving market dynamics. Successful mid-market buyouts often stem from strategic operational improvements and effective value creation techniques.

## 1. Market Overview

The mid-market private equity sector is a dynamic segment of the investment landscape, distinguished by its focus on companies with enterprise values typically falling between $50 million and $500 million. Another common definition places target companies within an annual revenue range of $10 million to $1 billion. Research providers like Pitchbook define mid-market buyout funds as those with assets under management (AUM) between $100 million and $5 billion.

**Industry Sectors Targeted:** Technology consistently emerges as a leading sector, accounting for approximately 33% of buyout deals by value and 26% by volume. The intersection of technology and healthcare is also a significant area of activity. Furthermore, financial services and industrials have demonstrated substantial growth in deal value in recent years. In the first half of 2024, technology, healthcare, and business services collectively represented about 60% of mid-market transaction value.

**Geographical Focus:** While specific geographical breakdowns for mid-market PE are not exhaustively detailed in all available data, broader private equity trends indicate significant activity concentrated in North America and Europe.

**Investment Thesis and Deal Structure:** Mid-market buyouts typically involve companies with annual EBITDA ranging from $5 million to $100 million. The investment thesis frequently centers on enhancing operational efficiency, implementing strategic growth initiatives, and ultimately divesting the business at a higher valuation. Investment sizes commonly range from $10 million to $100 million.

**Financing Methods:** Mid-market deals are generally financed with a lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to larger transactions. While specific average ratios vary, total debt often constitutes a majority of the purchase price, typically around 60-80%, leading to debt-to-equity multiples of approximately 2.0x to 3.0x. Senior debt usually comprises about 50% of the capital structure, with subordinated debt (high-yield debt) representing 20-30%, and equity making up the remaining 20-30%.

## 2. Sourcing Strategies

Sourcing compelling investment opportunities is a critical determinant of success in the mid-market PE landscape. Firms employ a variety of strategies to identify and secure potential buyouts.

**Proprietary Deal Sourcing:** Proprietary deal sourcing, which involves identifying and pursuing opportunities directly without competitive bidding, is highly valued. This approach often leads to more favorable terms and reduced competition. It relies heavily on a firm's established network, deep industry knowledge, and proactive outreach to business owners.

**Auction Processes and Intermediaries:** While proprietary sourcing is increasingly favored, auction processes, often managed by investment bankers, remain a significant channel. These processes typically involve higher multiples but require more time and effort. Intermediaries, including investment bankers and family offices, play a crucial role by leveraging their extensive networks and providing access to a broader range of potential opportunities.

**Role of Networking, Industry Knowledge, and Digital Platforms:** The effectiveness of deal origination is no longer solely dependent on relationships. Technology offers a significant competitive advantage. Digital deal origination platforms utilize data analytics to identify potential targets and prioritize efforts. This shift moves from a broad qualification process to an early identification of high-conviction assets. While precise quantifiable impacts are still emerging, the integration of technology and data analytics is integral to uncovering "hidden gems" and optimizing the allocation of limited partner time. Most high-quality private equity investments originate from or are influenced by a firm's established network. The combination of owner relationships, deal sourcing firms, direct outreach, and tech-enabled searches is essential for maintaining robust and diverse deal pipelines.

## 3. Performance Metrics

Evaluating the financial performance of mid-market PE buyouts involves scrutinizing key metrics and understanding evolving value creation methodologies.

**Key Performance Metrics:** Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Multiple on Invested Capital (MOIC) are standard benchmarks for assessing PE fund performance. Analysis indicates that small- and mid-cap deals have historically achieved a higher average MOIC of 2.8x compared to large-cap companies at 2.4x. Median IRRs for private capital funds typically fall within the range of 9.1% to 12.4%.

**Performance Trends and Value Creation:** Recent trends highlight a discernible shift towards operational excellence as the primary value creation lever. PE firms are increasingly focusing on tangible business improvements, such as revenue growth and margin expansion, rather than solely relying on financial engineering or multiple arbitrage. Technology enablement is a key component of this strategy, with investments in systems that enhance efficiency, improve reporting capabilities, and support better decision-making. Examples of value creation include optimizing supply chains, enhancing digital marketing strategies, implementing new enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems for improved data management, and investing in talent development programs to boost employee productivity and retention.

**Holding Periods:** The average holding period for private equity investments reached a record high of 6.8 years in 2023, reflecting a longer-term approach to value creation.

## 4. Recent Transactional Activity

The mid-market PE landscape has witnessed dynamic transactional activity, with emerging patterns in deal flow and exit strategies.

**Notable Transactions and Exit Activity:** Exit activity within the middle market has been a relative bright spot, with Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) activity showing signs of recovery. The US PE market experienced a significant rebound in 2024, with deal value increasing by 19.3% year-over-year to $838.5 billion and deal count growing by 12.8% to 8,473. Megadeals (valued at $5 billion or above) doubled in 2024, signaling a strong comeback in larger transactions. While specific notable mid-market transactions require ongoing detailed research, the overall trend points to increased deal-making.

**Emerging Patterns and Trends:** Observable shifts in sector preference and deal size are evident. Technology remains a dominant sector, with increased activity observed at the intersection of technology and healthcare. Financial services and industrials have also seen significant growth in deal value. Globally, average deal sizes have increased, with deals exceeding $1 billion constituting a substantial portion of the total value. Specifically in the US, technology deal value surged by 32.4% year-over-year, and software deal count rose by 27.5%, indicating a "flight to quality." The healthcare sector demonstrated resilience, with deal value increasing by 17.7% year-over-year. Industrials experienced a surge in activity early in 2024, although deal counts saw a slight year-over-year dip.

## 5. Challenges and Opportunities

Mid-market PE firms navigate a complex environment characterized by both significant challenges and promising opportunities.

**Challenges:**

**Increased Competition:** Intense competition for quality assets drives up acquisition multiples, creating valuation pressures.

**Economic and Industry Risks:** Economic downturns and industry-specific disruptions pose inherent risks to portfolio company performance.

**Operational Integration:** Post-acquisition integration, attracting and retaining key employees, and managing supply chain vulnerabilities are persistent operational challenges.

**Financial Risks:** Debt servicing, fluctuating interest rates, and the timing of exit opportunities present financial risks.

**Regulatory and Tax Landscape:** Navigating complex regulations, evolving tax policies, and industry-specific compliance requirements are significant hurdles.

**Market Risks:** The potential for overpaying due to competitive dynamics, industry volatility, and geographical concentration can impact returns.

**Opportunities:**

**Technological Advancements:** Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and data analytics can enhance deal sourcing, portfolio company operations, and overall efficiency.

**Market Dynamics:** Emerging market trends, shifts in consumer behavior, and evolving business models create new investment avenues.

**Demographic Trends:** Demographic shifts, such as an aging population or changes in workforce composition, can influence sector preferences and create demand for specific goods and services.

**Operational Improvement Focus:** The emphasis on operational excellence provides opportunities for PE firms to drive value creation through strategic improvements.

**Digital Transformation:** Assisting portfolio companies in their digital transformation journeys can unlock significant growth potential and efficiency gains.

## 6. Case Studies and Insights

Successful mid-market buyouts are often characterized by strategic execution and effective value creation techniques. While specific detailed case studies are beyond the scope of this preliminary report, general insights highlight key drivers of success.

**Strategic Moves and Value Creation:** Successful firms typically focus on enhancing operational efficiency, driving revenue growth through market expansion or new product development, and implementing robust management information systems. Strategic add-on acquisitions are also a common tactic to consolidate market share, expand product offerings, or enter new geographies. The ability to identify and integrate operational improvements, coupled with strong financial discipline, is paramount.

**Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations:** Collaborations with industry experts, operational consultants, and technology providers can significantly enhance a PE firm's ability to source deals and drive portfolio growth. Building strong relationships with intermediaries and management teams is also crucial. Furthermore, leveraging a firm's network for insights into specific industries or operational best practices can provide a competitive edge.

## Conclusion

The mid-market private equity buyout sector is characterized by a robust and evolving landscape. Sourcing strategies are increasingly sophisticated, with a pronounced shift towards proprietary deal origination supported by digital platforms and deep industry expertise. Performance trends indicate a move towards operational value creation, emphasizing tangible business improvements over financial engineering. While challenges such as heightened competition and valuation pressures persist, opportunities abound through technological advancements and dynamic market shifts. Successful mid-market PE firms adeptly combine strategic sourcing with focused operational improvements and effective value creation techniques to achieve superior returns.
