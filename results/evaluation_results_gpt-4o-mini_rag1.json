However, if I were to assume a hypothetical where he existed in D.C., it could imply needing to establish a new Groundhog Day there, starting essentially from the first year of that celebration.\n\nThus, the answer is that he has never made a prediction in Washington, D.C., and thus doesn't have an \"earlier\" timeframe that fits the premise given.\n\nTherefore, Punxsutawney Phil would need **0 years** to be canonically alive in Washington, D.C. for Groundhog Day \u2014 as he typically doesn't predict in that district.",

Thus, on August 1, 2024, he would be:\n     2024 - 1997 = 27 years old (and a few months).\n\n3.

His Bohr model of the atom incorporated quantum theory and explained how electrons could have stable orbits.  4. **Johannes Stark (1919)** - Stark was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields (the Stark effect), both phenomena that provided insights into atomic structure and quantum mechanics.  5. **James Franck and Gustav Hertz (1925)** - Franck and Hertz's Nobel Prize was awarded for their experiments on electron impacts in atoms, which confirmed quantum energy levels within atoms.",

    "prompt": "Which movie musical produced a song that was inspired by poetry from an American poet, who was born a week after Queen Victoria?",
    "ground_truth": "Fame",
    "llm_response": "The movie musical you are referring to is \"Fame\" (1980), which includes a song inspired by the poem \"I Sing the Body Electric\" by Walt Whitman, who was born on May 31, 1819, a week after Queen Victoria.",
    "evaluation_decision": "TRUE",
    "evaluation_explanation": "The \"Predicted Answer\" identifies the movie musical as \"Fame\" and provides additional context about the song inspired by Walt Whitman's poem, which aligns with the question asked. The \"Ground Truth Answer\" simply states \"Fame,\" which is indeed the correct answer to the question. Since the essential information and meaning of the \"Ground Truth Answer\" are present in the \"Predicted Answer,\" I conclude that the answer is correct.",

    "ground_truth": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid",
    "llm_response": "Diego Costa was playing for the Spanish national team when he was awarded the first FIFA World Cup goal based on a VAR decision. This occurred during the 2018 FIFA World Cup match against Portugal. While Diego Costa himself is known for playing at clubs like Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Chelsea, the specific inquiry is about his national team performance during the World Cup.",
    "evaluation_decision": "\"FALSE\"",
    "evaluation_explanation": "The \"Predicted Answer\" discusses Diego Costa's performance with the Spanish national team during the 2018 FIFA World Cup and mentions his club affiliations, specifically Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Chelsea. However, the \"Ground Truth Answer\" specifically asks for the club he was playing for when he was awarded the first FIFA World Cup goal based on a VAR decision. The \"Predicted Answer\" does not provide this information; it focuses on his national team performance without confirming that he was playing for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid at that time. Therefore, the essential fact that the \"Ground Truth Answer\" is asking for (the club he was playing for during that specific event) is not present in the \"Predicted Answer.\"",
