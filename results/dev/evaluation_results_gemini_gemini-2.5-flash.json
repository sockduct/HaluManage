She often addresses social justice, biodiversity, and the interaction between humans and their environments in her work.\n    *   Interestingly, Kingsolver lived briefly in the Congo during her early childhood, providing a personal connection to the novel's setting, though the book is not autobiographical.\n    *   \"The Poisonwood Bible\" is considered one of her most notable works, alongside other acclaimed novels like \"Demon Copperhead\" (for which she won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2023).\n\n*   **Summary of \"The Poisonwood Bible\":**\n    *   The novel tells the story of the Price family\u2014Baptist missionary Nathan Price, his wife Orleanna, and their four daughters (Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May)\u2014who move from Georgia, U.S., to the remote village of Kilanga in the Belgian Congo in 1959.\n    *   The title itself is symbolic, referring to Nathan Price's mispronunciation of a Kikongo phrase intended to mean \"Jesus is most precious\" but instead coming out as \"Jesus is poisonwood.\" This linguistic error highlights the cultural misunderstandings and destructive impact of his missionary zeal.\n    *   The narrative is told from the alternating perspectives of Orleanna and her four daughters, each offering a unique lens on their experiences in Africa. The story chronicles their struggles to adapt to the unfamiliar culture, the challenges of their father's rigid evangelism, and the political turmoil of the Congo on the cusp of independence.\n    *   Key plot points include the family's initial culture shock, their failed attempts at converting the villagers, their personal growth and divergence as individuals, and ultimately, a tragic snake bite that leads to the death of the youngest daughter, Ruth May.\n    *   After Ruth May's death, Orleanna and the remaining daughters leave Nathan, each embarking on very different paths shaped by their time in Africa. The story concludes with Ruth May's reflections from beyond the grave, emphasizing the Congolese concept of \"muntu\" (unity and interconnectedness).\n\n*   **Why it's a Notable Work:**\n    *   **Narrative Structure:** Critics, like John Mullan, have praised the book's remarkable narrative form, which offers a multifaceted perspective through the voices of five distinct characters.\n    *   **Historical Context:** It effectively uses the backdrop of the Belgian Congo's struggle for independence in the late 1950s and early 1960s to explore larger themes of colonialism, cultural arrogance, and the complexities of foreign intervention.\n    *   **Acclaim and Awards:** \"The Poisonwood Bible\" was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction and the PEN/Faulkner Award in 1999. It was also an Oprah's Book Club selection in 1999 and won the Boeke Prize in 2000.\n\n*   **Historical Context of the Setting (Belgian Congo):**\n    *   The Belgian Congo was a Belgian colony in Central Africa from 1908 until it gained independence on June 30, 1960, becoming the Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville).\n    *   The period leading up to independence (1959-1960), when the Price family arrives, was marked by increasing political instability and growing nationalist movements against Belgian colonial rule.\n    *   Belgian rule was characterized by a \"colonial trinity\" of state, missionary, and private-company interests, with a paternalistic approach that gradually faced internal criticism and Congolese resistance.\n    *   The novel vividly portrays the clash between Western missionary efforts and the rich, complex indigenous cultures, set against the dramatic backdrop of political upheaval and decolonization.",

It's worth noting that a prior U.S. patent for a 2x2x2 \"Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups\" was granted to Larry D. Nichols in 1972, which was found to be infringed upon by Rubik's 2x2x2 Pocket Cube, but not the 3x3x3 Cube.\n\nAs of January 2024, approximately 500 million Rubik's Cubes had been sold worldwide, making it the world's bestselling puzzle game and toy.",

    "evaluation_explanation": "The predicted answer discusses the history and patents of the Rubik's Cube. The ground truth answer provides a specific numerical value (\"98 Years\") and mentions \"Arlington, TX\" and \"Rubik's Cube\". While the predicted answer mentions \"Rubik's Cube\", it completely misses the numerical answer \"98 Years\" and \"Arlington, TX\", which are crucial components of the ground truth. Furthermore, the predicted answer does not address the core question about the time difference between a city's founding and Frank Fox's UK Patent (1344259).",
