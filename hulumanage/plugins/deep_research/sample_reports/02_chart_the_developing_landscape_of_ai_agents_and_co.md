## 1. Introduction and Background

Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents represent sophisticated software entities designed to perceive their environment, make informed decisions, and execute actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. The field has experienced explosive growth, transitioning from simple rule-based systems to highly adaptive and autonomous entities. This development is intrinsically linked to advancements in core AI technologies such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), natural language processing (NLP), and reinforcement learning (RL).

Traditional AI systems, such as early expert systems or basic search algorithms, often relied on predefined rules and logic, proving effective for specific, well-defined tasks but lacking the adaptability and autonomy of modern AI agents. In contrast, modern AI agents, powered by advanced ML techniques, can learn from data, adapt to dynamic environments, and make complex decisions with minimal human intervention. This shift is evident in the evolution from basic chatbots to sophisticated conversational agents capable of managing multi-turn dialogues and executing actions, as well as in the development of autonomous systems that plan, coordinate, and execute tasks over extended periods without constant human oversight [2].

The current landscape is characterized by the emergence of powerful foundational platforms and a diverse ecosystem of intertwined tools. These platforms, predominantly cloud-based, provide the necessary infrastructure and services for training, deploying, and managing AI agents. The accompanying tools range from specialized libraries for specific AI tasks to comprehensive development environments. Leading companies are making substantial investments in research and development, pushing the boundaries of what AI agents can accomplish.

## 2. Key Areas of Exploration

To provide a comprehensive understanding of this dynamic field, the following key areas have been explored:

The evolution of AI agent architectures signifies a critical shift from traditional, often "bolted-on" AI integrations, which yield limited returns, to deeply integrated, agentic AI designed for business transformation. McKinsey highlights that current enterprise software is moving towards an "agent-native" model, departing from static LLM-centric infrastructure towards dynamic, modular, and governed environments built for agent-based intelligence, often referred to as the "agentic AI mesh" [1]. This transition emphasizes modularity and resilience, crucial for integrating AI into core business processes.

### 2.2. Core AI Technologies Driving Agents

Several core AI technologies are fundamental to the advancement of AI agents:

#### Large Language Models (LLMs)
LLMs serve as foundational components for advanced AI agents, enabling sophisticated natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning capabilities. Transformer models, a key architecture for LLMs, have significantly improved performance in tasks like language modeling, translation, and summarization due to their ability to track relationships in sequential data and their parallel processing capabilities [5]. LLMs are integral to conversational agents and are increasingly used to imbue non-conversational agents with reasoning and planning abilities.

#### Reinforcement Learning (RL)
RL is crucial for enabling agents to learn from experience and optimize decision-making in complex environments. Beyond gaming, RL applications extend to robotic manipulation, autonomous systems for real-world decision-making, and optimizing complex processes such as blood pressure regulation in post-cardiac surgery patients [4].
