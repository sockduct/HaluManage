# Deep Research Sample Reports

This directory contains sample research reports generated using the [halumanage Deep Research plugin](https://github.com/codelion/halumanage) implementing the TTD-DR (Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher) algorithm from the paper ["Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR): Think More, Research More, Answer Better!"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16075v1).

## About TTD-DR

TTD-DR is an innovative approach that applies diffusion-inspired techniques to research generation at inference time. It performs iterative refinement through:
- Query decomposition and web search
- Gap analysis to identify missing information
- Multi-step denoising to improve report quality
- Reference aggregation from multiple sources

## Query Sources

These queries are derived from the [DeepConsult YDC Deep Research Evals](https://github.com/Su-Sea/ydc-deep-research-evals) repository, which provides challenging research questions designed to test the capabilities of AI research systems.

## How to Use

To generate similar research reports:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1"  # halumanage proxy
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deep_research-gpt-4o",  # Use deep_research prefix
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Your research query here"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Configuration

The deep research plugin supports several configuration options:

- `max_iterations`: Number of denoising iterations (default: 5)
- `max_sources`: Maximum number of web sources to fetch (default: 30)
- `search_delay`: Random delay between searches to avoid rate limiting (4-32 seconds)

For more details, see the [Deep Research implementation](https://github.com/codelion/halumanage/tree/main/halumanage/plugins/deep_research).
