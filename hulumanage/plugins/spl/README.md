# System Prompt Learning (SPL) Plugin for hulumanage

This plugin implements Andrej Karpathy's [proposed](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1921368644069765486) "third paradigm" for LLM learning, enabling large language models to learn and improve their problem-solving strategies over time through experience and reflection.

## Introduction: The Evolution of LLM Learning

Large Language Models (LLMs) have traditionally learned in two primary ways:
1. **Pretraining**: Learning facts, patterns, and language from massive text corpora
2. **Finetuning**: Learning behaviors through supervised or reinforcement learning

System Prompt Learning introduces a third paradigm:
3. **Strategy Learning**: The model learns explicit problem-solving strategies through experience, maintains them in a growing knowledge base, and applies them selectively based on problem types

This approach addresses a fundamental limitation of current LLMs—their inability to learn cumulatively from experience. While LLMs can solve individual problems impressively, they typically approach each new problem from scratch rather than building on past successes.

## The SPL Paradigm

System Prompt Learning represents a significant shift in how LLMs approach problem-solving:

- **Experience-Driven Learning**: Rather than relying solely on pretraining or supervised finetuning, SPL enables models to learn from their own problem-solving experiences
- **Strategy Formalization**: The system explicitly generates, evaluates, and refines problem-solving strategies
- **Performance Tracking**: SPL tracks which strategies work well for different problem types, creating a dynamic feedback loop
- **Selective Application**: When faced with a new problem, the system selects the most relevant strategies based on similarity and past performance

This approach mirrors how human experts develop expertise—by accumulating strategies through experience and applying them selectively to new situations.

## Experimental Results

We conducted extensive experiments using the SPL plugin with gemini-2.0-flash-lite on various benchmarks. The learning phase used the hulumanageBench training split (400 instances), while evaluation was performed on the test split (100 instances) and additional popular mathematical benchmarks.

The results demonstrate consistent improvements across all benchmarks:

| Benchmark | Baseline | With SPL | Improvement |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| hulumanageBench | 61% | 65% | +4% |
| MATH-500 | 85% | 85.6% | +0.6% |
| Arena Auto Hard | 29% | 37.6% | +8.6% |
| AIME24 | 23.33% | 30% | +6.67% |

These results are particularly notable for the challenging Arena Auto Hard and AIME24 benchmarks, where traditional approaches often struggle. The improvements suggest that SPL is especially effective for complex problem-solving tasks that benefit from strategic approaches.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Use the plugin by prefixing your model name with `spl-`:

```
spl-gpt-4o
```

### Combining with Other Plugins

SPL can be combined with other plugins using the `&` operator:

```
spl&memory-gpt-4o
```

### Learning Mode

By default, the plugin runs in inference-only mode, which uses existing strategies without creating or modifying them. To enable learning mode, which allows the plugin to create and refine strategies based on usage, add the `spl_learning` parameter to the request config:

```python
client.chat.completions.create(
    model="spl-gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": query}
    ],
    extra_body= {"spl_learning": True},
)
```

## How It Works

1. **Problem Classification**: The plugin analyzes each query to determine its problem type
2. **Strategy Selection**: It selects relevant strategies from its database based on the problem type and content
3. **System Prompt Augmentation**: Selected strategies (up to MAX_STRATEGIES_FOR_INFERENCE) are added to the system prompt

When learning mode is enabled, the plugin also performs:

4. **Effectiveness Evaluation**: After generating a response, the system evaluates how well each strategy worked
5. **Strategy Creation & Refinement**: The system creates new strategies for unseen problem types and periodically refines existing strategies based on usage

The plugin maintains two separate limits:
- **Storage Limit** (MAX_STRATEGIES_PER_TYPE): Controls how many strategies can be stored in the database per problem type
- **Inference Limit** (MAX_STRATEGIES_FOR_INFERENCE): Controls how many strategies are used during inference for system prompt augmentation

## Learning Metrics

After training on the hulumanageBench dataset, the system developed a rich knowledge base of strategies:

- **Total queries processed**: 500
- **Strategies created**: 129
- **Strategies refined**: 97
- **Successful resolutions**: 346
- **Strategies merged**: 28

These metrics indicate a healthy learning process with a balance between creation, refinement, and merging of similar strategies.

## Data Storage

Strategies are stored in JSON format in the `spl_data` directory:
- `strategies.json`: Contains all learned strategies
- `metrics.json`: Contains performance metrics and usage statistics

## Configuration

The SPL plugin maintains these core files:
- **Strategy Database**: `/hulumanage/plugins/spl/data/strategies.json`
- **Metrics**: `/hulumanage/plugins/spl/data/metrics.json`

You can:
1. Backup these files to preserve learned strategies
2. Edit the strategies.json file to manually add or modify strategies
3. Reset the learning by deleting these files (they will be recreated)

## Examples of Learned Strategies

The system learns diverse problem-solving approaches for different types of problems. Below are examples of strategies discovered by hulumanage during training:

### Strategy 1: Comprehensive Word Problem Strategy

A detailed, refined strategy for complex word problems (Success rate: 44.3%):

  "success_count": 84,
  "total_attempts": 193
}
```

### Strategy 3: Probability and Percentage Problems

A specialized strategy for probability and percentage calculations (Success rate: 51.9%):

```json
{
  "strategy_id": "strategy_5",
  "problem_type": "word_problem",
  "strategy_text": "1.  **Understand:**\n    *   Identify the question and the desired units of the answer (often a probability or a percentage).\n    *   Determine the problem type (e.g., rate, ratio, percentage, fraction, simple arithmetic, probability).

  "success_count": 126,
  "total_attempts": 243
}
```

### Strategy 4: Simple Calculation Strategy

A basic strategy for straightforward calculation problems:

```json

  "strategy_id": "strategy_6",
  "problem_type": "word_problem",
  "strategy_text": "Here's the problem-solving strategy:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knowns:**\n    *   Distance: 240 meters (length of the train, since it crosses a post)\n    *   Time: 16 seconds\n2.  **Identify the Unknown:** Speed of the train.\n3.  **Choose the Correct Formula:** Speed = Distance / Time\n4.  **Substitute Values:** Speed = 240 meters / 16 seconds\n5.  **Calculate the Answer:** Speed = 15 m/s\n6.  **Provide the Answer:** (Assuming answer choices are given, choose the letter corresponding to 15 m/s)"
}
```

### Key Observations

1. **Strategy Evolution**: The system develops increasingly sophisticated approaches as it encounters more problems
2. **Specialization**: Different strategies emerge for different problem subtypes (probability vs. basic calculations)
3. **Performance Tracking**: Success rates vary significantly, with specialized strategies often performing better on their target problem types
4. **Adaptive Refinement**: Strategies are continuously refined based on performance and new examples
5. **Human-Readable Knowledge**: All strategies remain interpretable and can be manually inspected or edited

These examples demonstrate how SPL enables models to build explicit, improvable knowledge bases rather than relying solely on implicit learning through parameter updates.

## Motivations and Broader Impact

### The System Prompt Gap

Most LLM providers like Anthropic (Claude) and OpenAI (GPT) employ elaborate system prompts that encode sophisticated problem-solving strategies. However, the majority of users interact with these models using very basic or empty system prompts, missing out on the benefits of strategic guidance.

SPL bridges this gap by automatically learning and applying effective strategies, democratizing access to the benefits of well-crafted system prompts without requiring expertise in prompt engineering.

### Learning from Experience

Current LLMs are often described as "one-shot learners"—they can solve individual problems but don't accumulate knowledge from these experiences. SPL represents a step toward models that improve through use, similar to how humans develop expertise through practice and reflection.

### Human-Readable Learning

Unlike black-box learning approaches, SPL produces human-readable strategies that can be inspected, understood, and even manually edited. This transparency allows for:
- Understanding how the model approaches different problems
- Identifying potential biases or flaws in reasoning
- Transferring strategies between models or domains

## Benefits

1. **Cumulative Learning**: The LLM improves on specific problem types over time
2. **Explicit Knowledge**: Strategies are human-readable and provide insight into the LLM's reasoning
3. **Efficiency**: Reuses successful approaches rather than solving each problem from scratch
4. **Adaptability**: Different strategies for different problem types
5. **Transparency**: Learning process and outcomes can be inspected and understood

## Conclusion and Future Work

System Prompt Learning represents a promising new direction for enabling LLMs to learn from experience in a transparent and interpretable way. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks, particularly for complex problem-solving tasks.

Future work will focus on:
1. Expanding the range of problem types the system can recognize
2. Improving the strategy refinement process
3. Enabling cross-domain strategy transfer
4. Developing mechanisms for human feedback on strategies
5. Exploring hybrid approaches that combine SPL with other learning paradigms
