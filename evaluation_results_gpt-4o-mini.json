For 10,000 people, the total yearly gross salary would be:  \n   \u20b1221,076 * 10,000 = \u20b12,210,760,000.\n\nNext, we convert this amount to USD using an average exchange rate of 57.29. \n\n4.

    "evaluation_explanation": "The Predicted Answer provides the necessary information to derive the answer to the question. It states that John Snow published his paper in 1847 and made the connection in 1854, which indicates a span of 7 years. The Ground Truth Answer is simply \"Seven,\" which is the same information expressed differently. Since the meaning and vital facts of the Ground Truth Answer are present in the Predicted Answer, I conclude that the essential information is conveyed.",
